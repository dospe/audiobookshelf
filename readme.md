# About this fork

This is [dospe](https://github.com/dospe)'s fork of [advplyr/audiobookshelf](https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf), kept close to upstream and deployed as a Docker stack in `/opt/audio` together with a Czech metadata provider. Fork versions are `<upstream version>-dospe.<n>` (for example `2.36.0-dospe.1`): the first part is the upstream release the fork is based on, the suffix grows with every fork change. The update check in the web client still compares against upstream releases.

What differs from upstream:

- `doc`, `docx`, `rtf` and `pdb` files are treated as ebooks, the web reader displays them and remembers display and text encoding settings per book
- A directory holding several ebooks is scanned as one library item per book (library setting "Split folders with multiple ebooks into separate books", on by default); files sharing a name without extension stay together as one book, author and series come from the parent folders
- The response timeout of custom metadata providers is configurable (`CUSTOM_METADATA_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT`, default 30 s)
- The Docker image is built from this repository and published as `ghcr.io/dospe/audiobookshelf` (`latest`, `edge` and the fork version)
- Deployment and update scripts in `scripts/` (`deploy.sh`, `update-server.sh`) for the `/opt/audio` stack: Audiobookshelf, the Czech metadata provider, Caddy HTTPS reverse proxy and an rclone mount

Fork documentation (Czech): [docs/UPDATE.cs.md](docs/UPDATE.cs.md) (install and update), [docs/EBOOKS.cs.md](docs/EBOOKS.cs.md) (ebook folders and Calibre), [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## ⚠️ Frontend pull requests are not being reviewed or merged for the existing Vue frontend. The frontend is currently being rewritten and migrated to React and should be available soon.

# Organizing your media

#### Directory structure and folder names are important to Audiobookshelf!

See [library docs](https://audiobookshelf.org/docs/category/libraries) for supported directory structures, folder naming conventions, and audio file metadata usage.

<br />

# Installation

See [install docs](https://audiobookshelf.org/docs/category/installation)

<br />

# Reverse Proxy Set Up

#### Important! Audiobookshelf requires a websocket connection.

#### Note: Using a subfolder is supported with no additional changes but the path must be `/audiobookshelf` (this is not changeable). See [discussion](https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/discussions/3535)

See [reverse proxy docs](https://audiobookshelf.org/docs/category/reverse-proxy)

# Run from source

This application is built using [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/).

### Dev Container Setup

The easiest way to begin developing this project is to use a dev container. An introduction to dev containers in VSCode can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).

Required Software:

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

_Note, it is possible to use other container software than Docker and IDEs other than VSCode. However, this setup is more complicated and not covered here._

<details>
<summary>Install the required software on Windows with <a href=(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/#production-recommended)>winget</a></summary>

<p>
Note: This requires a PowerShell prompt with winget installed.  You should be able to copy and paste the code block to install.  If you use an elevated PowerShell prompt, UAC will not pop up during the installs.

```PowerShell
winget install -e --id Docker.DockerDesktop; `
winget install -e --id Microsoft.VisualStudioCode
```

After installing these packages, you can now install the [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) extension for VSCode. After installing this extension open the command pallet (`ctrl+shift+p` or `cmd+shift+p`) and select the command `>Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container`. This will cause the development environment container to be built and launched.

You are now ready to start development!

### Manual Environment Setup

If you don't want to use the dev container, you can still develop this project. First, you will need to install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/) (version 20) and [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/).

Next you will need to create a `dev.js` file in the project's root directory. This contains configuration information and paths unique to your development environment. You can find an example of this file in `.devcontainer/dev.js`.

You are now ready to build the client:

```sh
npm ci
cd client
npm ci
npm run generate
cd ..
```

### Development Commands

After setting up your development environment, either using the dev container or using your own custom environment, the following commands will help you run the server and client.

To run the server, you can use the command `npm run dev`. This will use the client that was built when you ran `npm run generate` in the client directory or when you started the dev container. If you make changes to the server, you will need to restart the server. If you make changes to the client, you will need to run the command `(cd client; npm run generate)` and then restart the server. By default the client runs at `localhost:3333`, though the port can be configured in `dev.js`.

You can also build a version of the client that supports live reloading. To do this, start the server, then run the command `(cd client; npm run dev)`. This will run a separate instance of the client at `localhost:3000` that will be automatically updated as you make changes to the client.

If you are using VSCode, this project includes a couple of pre-defined targets to speed up this process. First, if you build the project (`ctrl+shift+b` or `cmd+shift+b`) it will automatically generate the client. Next, there are debug commands for running the server and client. You can view these targets using the debug panel (bring it up with (`ctrl+shift+d` or `cmd+shift+d`):

- `Debug server`—Run the server.
- `Debug client (nuxt)`—Run the client with live reload.
- `Debug server and client (nuxt)`—Runs both the preceding two debug targets.
